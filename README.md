# Thesis Guidelines
_A Work-in-Progress set of instructions and hints for writing (better) theses at CTU._

For sake of brevity, we target only LaTeX format. If you are brave enough to write your thesis in, e.g., Word... I wish you luck. But these instructions should be also helpful.

Another good source are from IMR [here](https://imr.ciirc.cvut.cz/uploads/Education/jak_napsat_BP.pdf) and [here](https://imr.ciirc.cvut.cz/uploads/Education/jak_prezentovat.pdf) (both Czech only).

## tl;dr

These are only hints. You should at least stick to:

- **Be consistent.** = No matter which style you use, use it consistenly.
- **Be clear.** = Re-read your sentences. Avoid complicated wording.
- _TODO: Add more._


## Template

There are two basic templates for the thesis:
- [ctuthesis](https://github.com/tohecz/ctuthesis)
  - Remove line `\setlength{\parskip}{5ex plus 0.2ex minus 0.2ex}` to get rid of large vertical spaces.
  - Remote `preprint = \ctuverlog` to get rid of git hash from each page.
- [ctustyle](http://petr.olsak.net/ctustyle-e.html)


For writing the LaTeX documents I personally use [latexextra.tex](https://github.com/jara001/latexextra.tex). Some parts of that are placed here. You can use it as a reference for 'how to do stuff slightly differently'.


## Text typeset

1. Be consistent. It is helpful to set your own macros for various names to avoid using different capitalization:
```latex
\usepackage{xspace}
\newcommand{\MyCustomName}{Very CoOl WeirdLY capitalZed name\xspace}
```
_Note: The `\xspace` is replaced with a space only when it is necessary, therefore you do not have to use `\MyCustomName{}`, but `\MyCustomName`. The first variant ensures that there will be no space in any condition._

_Another note: `xspace` might act weirdly. But it has never happened to me._

2. Use non-breaking spaces in the names, where necessary. For example, if you want to talk about second Starcraft, use `Stacraft~II`.
3. Quotation marks are **NOT** done using `"`. That is a symbol for inch.
  - English quotation marks are: **``** before text and **''** after the text. Note, that the second one is two times **'**. Differences can be seen [here](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/QuotDash.html).
  - Czech quotation marks are done using `\uv{}`. This requires `\usepackage[czech]{babel}` or `\usepackage{cslatex}`.
4. Writing a list of items in better done as an enumerated one as it looks slightly better:
_...and we used multiple approaches: (i) Follow The Gap, (ii) Pure Pursuit, and (iii) some other cool technique._

You can use environment [`inlinelist`](https://github.com/jara001/latexextra.tex/blob/d3b877b06cade6557256f2435566307028b262bd/latexextra.tex#L191-L212) to do this:
```latex
and we used multiple approaches:
\begin{inlinelist}
    \item Follow The Gap,
    \item Pure Pursuit, and
    \item some other cool technique.
\end{inlinelist}%
```
_Note: End `%` ensures that there will be no linebreak._

## Equations

1. Equations are (generally) not cited in themselves. It is better to cite them beforehand, e.g., `The Newton's first law is [1]:`.
2. To improve readability, don't hesitate to use dot product symbol. It is written as `\cdot`.
3. You can use custom macros in the equations as well. If you want to use it inside and outside of the equation, do this: `\newcommand{\MyVariable}{\ensuremath{V}\xspace}`. It will surround the variable with math environment if necessary.
4. Equations are part of a sentence. They usually contains commas `,` or dots `.` at the end of the sentence.
5. The line above means that there is no reason to indent next line after the equation. Use `\noindent` afterwards.


## Figures

1. Figure captions are sentences. So they end with a period.
2. The command `\caption` can also handle an optional argument. That is used in the list of figures. Use it when the captions itself is too long, contains references, etc.


## References

1. Use `cleverref`. It will accompany each reference with its type (e.g., Figure). When the reference starts the sentence, use `\Cref{}`, otherwise use `\cref{}`; `Figure 1` x `Fig. 1`.
_Note: Import `cleverref` this way: `\usepackage[capitalise]{cleveref}`._


## Citations

1. Every `\cite` has to be accompanied with a non-breaking space `~` to avoid putting the reference number on a next line; e.g., `in~\cite{cool-paper}`.
2. If you want to cite more papers at once, use them in one command; don't do `\cite{one-paper} \cite{second-paper}`, but `\cite{one-paper,second-paper}`. It will also change the way it is set; `[1] [2]` vs. `[1, 2]`.
